class Reverse

=begin
  Given a string (sentence) the execute method should be able to reverse the order of those words.

  Example Input:  "the cat and the hat"
  Example Output: "hat the and cat the"

  Note: for simplicity commas, periods and the like are considered part of the word.

  One last thing.. Please implement by test driving the code.

  Extra Credit:

  If the sentence includes extra whitespace surrounding words, a flag should be able to be provided to the method
  to either preserve or strip extra whitespace.

  Example Input: "the quick brown      fox     jumps over the lazy dog"

  Example Output (strip whitespace mode):    "dog lazy the over jumps fox brown quick the"
  Example Output (preserve whitespace mode): "dog lazy the over jumps     fox      brown quick the"
